# Blue Lady

A modified version of the default Casper theme included with [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

This version is used at [The Gallimaufry](https://thegallimaufry.show).

The Blue Lady is a [ghost](https://www.islandeye.co.uk/history/historic-parks/priory-bay-hotel.html) which is supposed to haunt the Priory Bay Hotel on the Isle of Wight, an island off the south coast of England. I thought it seemed appropriate to name our version of the Casper theme after another ghost.
